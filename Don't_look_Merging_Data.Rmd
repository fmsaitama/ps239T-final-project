# Merge the files with County name and State FIPS code (tried to merge wiwhtcounty name and found many counties with the same name, so merged by two variavles instead)

```{r}
total<- merge(census,census2010,by=c("county_name","state_fips"))
total2 <- merge(y,total,by=c("county_name","state_fips"))
```

# Create Population growth data and Income growth data, using the merged data

```{r}

total2$pop_growth <- (total2$Population - total2$Population10)/total2$Population10
total2$income_growth <- (total2$MedianIncome - total2$MedianIncome10)/total2$MedianIncome10

summary(total2)
```
